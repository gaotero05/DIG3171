  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>A murder mystery loosely inspired by TV show narratives of the same vein. There are several clues to lead to the true identity and motive of the killer, but be careful, not all clues lead to killer. It’s up to you to determine which clues incriminate and which exonerate, good luck! </p>
