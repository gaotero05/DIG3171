# Abstract

Why have “Triple A” games declined in quality so dramatically over the past couple
years? It seems that over the past decade game industry titans like Activision, Ubisoft, and EA
have all become shells of their former selves quickly being outpaced by indie games despite their
smaller size. Over the course of this last decade, “Triple A” games have rapidly lost favor among
consumers who claim most content being put out by these studios is lazy, unfinished, repetitive,
or in most cases a combination of the three. This is a worrying trend as it doesn’t seem to be
studio exclusive but rather an industry issue that seems to be affecting all games. This research
paper will identify some of the main points being made as to why the trend is happening and
determine to what extent they are impacting the industry. The points made in this paper are based
off research conducted using google scholar, and sources found in the UCF library. This research
will help back claims made by providing real world examples and including examples of what is
being done right and wrong in the industry. The key issues discussed are pricing models for
“Triple A” games, the rise in quality and subsequent popularity of indie games, and the decline in
care and polish put forth for “Triple A” games. Pricing models are one of the main problems with
“Triple A” games lately as publishers have started charging $80 for products, they charged $60
for originally (Eden, Lawrence) or adopting a “Free-to-play” model with microtransactions
(Bernevega). The rise in quality for Indie games has meant that a large quantity of people have
started to turn away from “Triple A” games (Pérez Latorre, Óliver) as they are no longer are
required to look at big publishing studios to find superior products (Swain, Chris). The declining
quality of “Triple A” games has led to a sharp decline in customer interest, the main pull for
game from big publishers has been the assumption that they would be getting a superior product
(Lipkin, Nadav) however, this sentiment has quickly dissipated in recent time due to these large
studios lack of care and passion for their projects. The points made in this paper are significant as
they show an inversion of the relationship between “Triple A” games and Indie titles, where large
publishers were expected to produce high quality products and indie games were seen as lacking
in “budget advertising and popularity” (Lipkin, Nadav) but now the roles have reversed. This is a
meaningful change to observe as it means consumers are unsure of the quality of what they’re
buying, the most expensive product on the market could be comparable, or in some cases, lower
quality to cheaper alternatives and has led to disillusionment among consumers.

This article explores triple A games and their recent changes in monetization structure. It
explains what the “Free to play” model is and how recent triple A developers have started to
adopt it. This article will be used to explain how recent changes in monetization structure have

This article discusses the rising prices of video games and the shifting strategy for
monetization Triple A games have had over the past couple years. They do this by providing
examples of games that had price increases for similar products they make and highlighting
any pricing changes that make apparent their increased greed. The information found in this
article will be used to outline how Triple A game publishers have changed their pricing
structures in a way that harms the consumers, and subsequently their games.

This article focuses on how video games in general started to become more mainstream
among the public. It highlights the stereotypes of video games and people who played them
and how they changed over time to become how they are today. This article will help explain
how triple A games came to be and the standard that they started to be held at.

This journal focuses on the increased use of microtransactions in games and how their
implementation is similar to gambling mechanics. It explains the history of how triple A games
started implementing these mechanics, what their goals were with them, why they have
become a common feature, and why they are still prevalent to this day. I will use it to show
how addictive gambling microtransactions have contributed to the downfall of triple A game
studios and resulted in lower quality content for consumers.

The book this was pulled from was about “simulation gaming through times and
disciplines.” The section being referenced speaks on the monetization systems in games put out
by Triple A development studios. In this section game monetization tactics over the years are
outlined, and in addition to how they impacted the industry. I will use this information to
explain how certain monetization practices have hurt creativity and encouraged laziness among
larger studios who prioritize monetary gain over the quality of their product.

This is an article that looks at the different definitions that indie games have had over the
years and exploring the different attributes of them that put them in those categories. This will
help not only define indie games but also show how they differ from Triple A games and have
started to split away from them in terms of quality.

does this by exploring the differences between the two and their opposing natures and designs.
This article will help accomplish many things, firstly aid in providing a definition for Indie
games. Secondly, explain how Indie games act as opposites to triple A games. And thirdly, help
show how Indie games have developed over the years.

This section forms a textbook poses the idea that quality content is not strictly facilitated
by a large publishing studio or team. This section of the text states that even without the
financial and labor support of big companies’ quality content can still be produced and
advantage indie creators. I will use this to support my claims about indie title being able to
produce equal or better content to triple A game publishers.

This article focuses on how video games entered the mainstream and how that led to
profitability from the newfound popularity. It does this by examining the increased interest in
the field and the new jobs being created by the boom. This will help show how the increased
interest in video games lead to triple A studios starting to become profit centered.
