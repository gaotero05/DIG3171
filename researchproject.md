# Abstract

Why have “Triple A” games declined in quality so dramatically over the past couple
years? It seems that over the past decade game industry titans like Activision, Ubisoft, and EA
have all become shells of their former selves quickly being outpaced by indie games despite their
smaller size. Over the course of this last decade, “Triple A” games have rapidly lost favor among
consumers who claim most content being put out by these studios is lazy, unfinished, repetitive,
or in most cases a combination of the three. This is a worrying trend as it doesn’t seem to be
studio exclusive but rather an industry issue that seems to be affecting all games. This research
paper will identify some of the main points being made as to why the trend is happening and
determine to what extent they are impacting the industry. The points made in this paper are based
off research conducted using google scholar, and sources found in the UCF library. This research
will help back claims made by providing real world examples and including examples of what is
being done right and wrong in the industry. The key issues discussed are pricing models for
“Triple A” games, the rise in quality and subsequent popularity of indie games, and the decline in
care and polish put forth for “Triple A” games. Pricing models are one of the main problems with
“Triple A” games lately as publishers have started charging $80 for products, they charged $60
for originally (Eden, Lawrence) or adopting a “Free-to-play” model with microtransactions
(Bernevega). The rise in quality for Indie games has meant that a large quantity of people have
started to turn away from “Triple A” games (Pérez Latorre, Óliver) as they are no longer are
required to look at big publishing studios to find superior products (Swain, Chris). The declining
quality of “Triple A” games has led to a sharp decline in customer interest, the main pull for
game from big publishers has been the assumption that they would be getting a superior product
(Lipkin, Nadav) however, this sentiment has quickly dissipated in recent time due to these large
studios lack of care and passion for their projects. The points made in this paper are significant as
they show an inversion of the relationship between “Triple A” games and Indie titles, where large
publishers were expected to produce high quality products and indie games were seen as lacking
in “budget advertising and popularity” (Lipkin, Nadav) but now the roles have reversed. This is a
meaningful change to observe as it means consumers are unsure of the quality of what they’re
buying, the most expensive product on the market could be comparable, or in some cases, lower
quality to cheaper alternatives and has led to disillusionment among consumers.
