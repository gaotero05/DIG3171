# Distant Reading Assignment 

## Voyant
-	What can you discern about the text from these results?
  
I can discern that the text uses certain words several times.

- What can't you know from these results?

I have no way of discerning the context behind them using these words at any point and at times can be very misleading.

- Are these results accurate?

No, the results go into more than the article itself, voyant dove into other articles on the website which affected the word results even though I only input one link to one article.

## CoPilot
- What can you discern about the text from these results?
  
Instantly I am able to discern significantly more/higher quality information from CoPilot, it tells me the contents of the article and surrounding information needed to understand what is being conveyed.

- What can't you know from these results?
  
I won’t know exactly what is being said in the article since it is being fed through an AI that is filtering back the information it has found, however every point being made has a link to back up its sources and allows you to do your own research.

- Are these results accurate?
  
From the parts I recognize it seems to be accurate. But it also includes sources to do my own research with and back up its points.
